	<p id="Overview" style="text-align:center;"> Overview:</p>

	<p style="text-align:center;">This is a page for all Arsenal fans created by Raphael Steiner: I have been an Arsenal fan my whole life and last year's FA Cup victory was one of the happiest moments of my life. My favorite players are Thierry Henry (I am also a NYRB fan), Aaron Ramsey, Serge Gnabry, Gedion Zelalem, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, and although he might be leaving, Thomas Vermaelan. I obviously hate RVP and Nasri. I'm extremely excited about bringing in Alexis Sanchez and Debuchy. If we can get a quality CDM like Khedira, Schneiderlin or Bender we will be champions! A.K.B </p>

	<p id="July_Twenty-twoP" style="text-align:center;"> More Transfer Rumors! As Thomas Vermaelen's exit to the Red Devils (not Belgium) becomes more and more likely, papers have begun to link us with a swap for either Smalling or Jones. Personally, I don't rate either, and I would much rather pursue Majila Nastasic of Manchester City. In other news, the Boss has decided to give our World cup Winners (BFG, Podolski, and Ozil) extra vacation time that would see them return after the Community Shield match against City and maybe even the first match against Crystal Palace. Although I agree that they deserve rest, the decison shows a lack of respect for the cup and slight lack of ambition. I hope that they elect to return early, especially Mertesacker and Ozil, who had a bit of a bust up after the dissapointing 6-3 loss last season. </p>

	<p id="July_Twenty-oneP" style="text-align:center;">  The gunners have landed in NYC! I am incredibly excited to see my two favorite teams play each other, even if it's only a friendly. Also, papers haveing been linking us with the precociously talented William Caravlho. Reports claim that &pound;24M would be enough to get him. However, the sum would have to be paid in one installment, which might be problematic as the Arsenal board would rather pay over time. Personally, I would prefer signing Khedira but either one would be fantastic. Lastly 	Arsene Wenger said that we would not be signing anymore players at the striker position. I, unlike many supporters, agree with the decision because it will allow young players like Campell, Sanogo, Gnabry and Akpom to shine. Youth and talent development has allways been a huge aspect of our club and it needs to be maintained even during this period of huge spending. </p>
